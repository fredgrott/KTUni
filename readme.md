# KTUni

## Why Reactive App Arch for Androiid Apps?

Solutions like Groupon Grox only supply the state decoupling whereas I prefer to combine the 
Facebook's Flux and Elm's Redux solution to fully decouple bhothe the Ui and app arch 
components and decouple the state.

Plus, translating from javascript to java and than to Kotlin is just frosting on the cake as far as 
proving Senior Android level approach to positively impacting app conversions by preventing App freezes.

My library solution is called KTUniLib

## Sample Todod App

Screenshots will be here soon along with videos.
